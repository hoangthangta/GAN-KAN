# KAN-GAN
Semi-supervised learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (SGANs) using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Layers (KANLs)

In this repo, we set up GANs using MLP layers (MLP-GAN) and KAN layers (KAN-GAN). We compared the performance between those and found KAN-SGAN outperformed MLP-SGAN. We will publish our paper soon.
